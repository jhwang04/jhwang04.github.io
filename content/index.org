* About Me
I am a first-year Computer Engineering major with concentrations in Computing Hardware and Robotics. I chose this
field of study because I wanted to learn how computers work on a fundamental level, and to develop programming
skills with concrete applications.

One of these physical applications is with Hytech Racing, Georgia Tech's Electric FSAE team.
Over the past two semesters, I have learned electric engineering fundamentals and contributed
to a revamped firmware system.

In my free time, I play intramural sports, sing in Georgia Tech Chamber Choir, and attend
meetings for a campus ministry (Reformed University Fellowship).

I strive to develop both technical and communication skills in professional engineering
environments. I actively seek situations where I am the least experienced. I believe that
my detail-orientedness, discipline, and curiosity will allow me to make meaningful
contributions to any engineering team.

** Thermistor Board Project (Hytech Racing)
For Hytech, we needed an array of thermistors to measure temperature data at many different
points. Initially, this was designed to measure data in an array between two large aluminum
plates to to verify their thermal properties. /[[./thermistorBoard/thermistorBoard.org][(read more)]]/
