* About Me
I am a second-year Computer Engineering major with concentrations in Computing Hardware and Robotics. I chose this
field of study because I wanted to learn how computers work on a fundamental level and develop programming
skills with concrete applications.

One of these physical applications is with Hytech Racing, Georgia Tech's Electric FSAE team.
Over the past few semesters, I have learned electric engineering fundamentals and contributed
to a revamped firmware system. For the 2024-25 school year, I am Hytech's Low Voltage Electronics
lead. I am responsible for all LV board design, fabrication, and wire harnessing, as well as all
firmware for this year's car.

In my free time, I like to play intramural sports, sing in Georgia Tech Chamber Choir, run,
and attend meetings for a campus ministry (Reformed University Fellowship).

I strive to develop both technical and communication skills in professional engineering
environments. I actively seek situations where I am the least experienced. I believe that
my detail-orientedness, discipline, and curiosity will allow me to make meaningful
contributions to any engineering team.

* Career Goals
In the next few years, I hope to graduate with a Master's degree in Electrical and Computer
Engineering and work full-time.

I plan to stay involved in Hytech Racing over the next few years to gain practical engineering experience. I have
found that I really enjoy the fast-paced environment and I'm excited to see what else I
will learn.

I also hope to get an internship or co-op starting *Spring/Summer 2025*. An internship
would help me to develop practical skills in a more profesional environment.

* Technical Projects
** Emacs Org note-taking /(Spring 2024 - Present)/
During CS classes, I take notes using a combination of Emacs Org-mode and LaTeX. This allows
me to take notes in a markdown-like environment, but compile it into clean PDFs. Emacs is
highly configurable, and I have really enjoyed using various features to take notes quickly
and elegantly during class. /[[./noteTaking/noteTaking.html][(read more)]]/

** JUnit-style test cases /(Fall 2023 - Spring 2024)/
In my Object-Oriented Programming (CS 1331) and Data Structures/Algorithsm (CS 1332) classes,
students are encouraged to share tester files for the homework assignments on the class forum.
My friend and I began working together to write the most elegant, thorough, and compartmentalized
tester files to monopolize the market. *In total, we published over 25,000 lines of code and
reached an estimated 4,000+ downloads.* /[[./junits/junits.html][(read more)]]/

** Thermistor Board Project (Hytech Racing) /(Fall 2023)/
For Hytech, we needed an array of thermistors to measure temperature data at many different
points. Initially, this was designed to measure data in an array between two large aluminum
plates to to verify their thermal properties. /[[./thermistorBoard/thermistorBoard.org][(read more)]]/
