* Overview
During CS classes, I take notes using a combination of Emacs Org-mode and LaTeX. This allows
me to take notes in a markdown-like environment, but compile it into clean PDFs. Emacs is
highly configurable, and I have really enjoyed using various features to take notes quickly
and elegantly during class. The following notes were taken *in real-time* and were not
reformatted/modified after the lecture.

* Why?
For my Discrete Math class, we often use mathematical and logical symbols
such as AND ($\land$), OR ($\lor$), FOR ALL ($\forall$), etc. These symbols
make typed notes particularly difficult. However, we often need to write out
full sentences to provide conclusions for our proofs, which poses a challenge
for handwritten notes.

One possible solution is to take notes in LaTeX, which would help with both
formatting and speed. However, I often found it difficult to type the
=\begin{center}=, =\begin{tabular}=, and other LaTeX tags.

The solution I preferred was to use Emacs Org, which allows me to take
readable notes in a markdown-like environment, but insert LaTeX snippets
and colored boxes without much trouble.

* Note-taking process

Here is an example of some un-rendered notes. Most of the time, during class, this
is what my screen looks like. I configured several Emacs snippets using the =YASnippet=
plugin to insert the =\begin{verbatim}= and =\end{verbatim}= lines at the end, which
formats the output in a gray, monospace box.

* Reflection

Overall, this "project" has been really interesting. I did not start the semester
planning on learning a new system for note-taking, but this was a solution I stumbled
upon. For the most part, this project has drastically improved my proficiency
in Emacs as a super-customizeable text editor, and with Org-Mode specifically. /(If you couldn't tell, this portfolio website is written in Emacs, using Org's export mode to convert it to HTML!)/

However, there are several things I would do differently if I were to re-learn these skills from the ground up.
1) *Configure YASnippets first.* If I had learned how to use this plugin earlier in the semester,
   I would have been able to save significant time while learning the LaTeX shortcuts.
2) *Learn LaTeX separately.* Part of what made Org difficult at the very beginning is that
   Org generated LaTeX, which exported to a PDF. If I was not happy with the PDF formatting,
   it was difficult to tell if the issue was with Org's formatting or with LaTeX. If I had
   learned pure LaTeX separately, it would have made the learning curve much less steep.
3) *Consider other options.* I do not regret using Emacs Org-Mode, but I would not necessarily
   recommend this as a note-taking system. I chose this over Notion and Obsidian because I
   felt it would have more customizability, and because I already had prior experience with
   Emacs. If someone is looking to learn a new note-taking system, though, I would either
   recommend Obsidian or NeoVim, since those have more recent documentation and cross-platform
   compatibility.
