At HyTech Racing, our car becomes more complex every year. As a result, the learning curve for
new members becomes steeper every year. I wanted to increase two things: the number of actively-contributing
members, and the contributions of each member. To this end, I designed a guided, asynchronous
set of training modules that forms a semester-long curriculum.

As I alluded to in the introduction, HyTech Racing struggles a little with member retention.
To give some context, when I joined the team, there were over 70 people who were interested
in joining the electrical subteam. By the end of the year, there were only 4 or 5 who still
came, but every member was routinely staying in the shop past 4AM.
</p>

<p>
I often wondered how both things could be true&#x2013; How can we have so much interest in the club,
and yet so few people who can do the work? So, to mitigate this problem, I decided to create
a full electrical training curriculum with the following priorities:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Make it easier, but don't lower the bar.</li>
<li>Resources should be <i>asynchronous</i>.</li>
<li>Resources should be <i>guided</i>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Goal #1's motivation is clear. We don't want our simplification to compromise the car's
performance. Our members still need to be responsible for learning the same content, it
just should be easier to do so.
</p>

<p>
Goal #2 stemmed from my own personal experience. I often find that self-paced study is the
most effective for my own understanding, since I can read (and re-read) an article or
textbook until I really understand it. At HyTech, it's far more important to really
understand certain concepts, while in classes, it's usually possible to get by with a
cursory understanding. By making resources asynchronous, a highly-motivated member can
learn all the concepts at their own pace.
</p>

<p>
Goal #3 also stemmed from my own experience, but from a different angle. I often found
myself stuck trying to learn a particulary obscure concept. When I finally ended up
asking one of the leads about it, they'd say "Oh, you don't really need to know that.
This is the essential part for now, and the rest will make sense later." To prevent
other people from having this experience, I felt that frequent "checkpoints" would
give members the opportunity to ask questions and make sure they're on the right track.

When I started using Khanacademy in 3rd grade to learn math, they had a feature called
the "knowledge map".
